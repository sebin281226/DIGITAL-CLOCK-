TESTING PROCEDURE

1) Oscillator Test (CD4060):
Check that the oscillator generates a stable signal using a 32.768 kHz crystal.
Verify the 1 Hz output by connecting an LED—it should blink once per second.

2) Seconds Counter Test (CD4026):
Apply the 1 Hz pulse to the first CD4026. The display should count 0–9, then
reset. The carry-out pulse should trigger the next CD4026 for tens of seconds (0–
5).

3) Minutes and Hours Counter Test:
Connect carry-outs properly and confirm that minutes increment after 60
seconds and hours after 60 minutes. Ensure correct rollover at 23→00 (24-hour)
or 12→1 (12-hour).

4) Reset and Set Functions:
Press reset to confirm all counters return to 00:00:00. Check that hour and
minute set buttons work properly.

5) Display and Accuracy Check:
Ensure all 7-segment displays show clear digits without flicker. Let the clock run
for a few hours and compare with a standard clock to verify time accuracy.

6) Led’s connected to counters:
Keeping led’s on the end of each counters to indicate 1Hz Supply on the counter
