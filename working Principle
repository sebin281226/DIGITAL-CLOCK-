The Digital Clock using CD4060 and CD4026 ICs works on the principle of
frequency division and sequential counting to display real time in hours,
minutes, and seconds. The operation can be divided into three main
functional sections:


1. Time Base Generation (CD4060 – Oscillator and Divider)
● The CD4060 IC acts as an oscillator and 14-stage binary counter.
● A 32.768 kHz quartz crystal is connected to its oscillator pins,
producing a stable frequency used in digital clocks and watches.
● The internal flip-flop stages divide this frequency down to 1 Hz (one
pulse per second).
● The 1 Hz output from the CD4060 provides the basic time signal that
drives the counting section.


2. Counting and Display (CD4026 – Counter and Decoder)
● The CD4026 is a decade counter with an inbuilt 7-segment display
driver.
● Each incoming clock pulse increases its count by one (0–9) and
updates the display automatically—no external decoder is needed.
● When a CD4026 completes a full count (after 10 pulses), its carry-out
(CO) pin sends a pulse to the next CD4026, enabling cascading
between digit positions


3. Time Display Sequence
● Seconds: Two CD4026 ICs are used — one for units (0–9) and one for
tens (0–5).
● Minutes: Two CD4026 ICs handle the minute digits in the same way.
● Hours: One or two CD4026 ICs count hours (depending on 12-hour or
24-hour format).
● After 59 seconds, the seconds section resets to 00, and the carry pulse
increments the minute counter.
● After 59 minutes, minutes reset, and hours increment.
● After 12 or 24 hours, the entire clock resets to 00:00:00.


4. Reset and Adjustment
● A reset switch initializes the clock to 00:00:00.
● Optional set buttons can feed manual pulses to the minute or hour
counters for time adjustment.
● Power is supplied by a 5V–9V DC source, and current-limiting resistors
(220–330 Ω) protect the 7-segment displays.
